# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis for PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company 

## PyBer_Analysis Objective
Exploratory analysis to identify the relationship between the type of city and number or drivers and riders.
This analysis results will provide Pyber with insights to improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserve neighborhood.

#### Overall Findings:
* Although the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4 and 3.5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively, the average fare is higher.

* There is one outlier in the urban ride count data, and no outliers for rural and suburban ride count and fare of rides. However, the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

* Urban fares represent more than 60% of total fares

* Rural rides represent 5.3% of total rides

* Less than 1% of drivers are rural drivers

#### Finding from the challenge:
* It is possible to see that total urban’s fare is around 4 times more that rural’s fare and 2 times more than suburban’s fare. The total fare variance along the months can be smaller in the rural than in the urban type of cities.

*  It is possible to see that the average fare per ride and per driver are higher in rural areas than in urban areas. But the number of total rides and Drivers are considerably lower.

#### Recommendation:
For further analysis, it would be interesting to understand if the amount of drivers in rural area is attending the demand that they have there probably analyzing the waiting time, before the ride. This new information will or not suggest increasing the number of drivers in those type of cities.
